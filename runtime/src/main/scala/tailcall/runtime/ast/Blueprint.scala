/**
 * Document is an intermediate representation of a GraphQL
 * document. It has two features â€” 1. It is serializable and
 * 2. It has logic to resolve fields into actual values.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: we should keep this as close to Caliban's AST
 * as much as possible. The idea is that sometimes we might
 * need some changes in Caliban's AST, for eg: we need to
 * generate a ZIO Schema of the Caliban AST. This is
 * currently not possible because the case classes are not
 * final. Instead of opening a PR in Caliban, we can just
 * make the changes here and then use the modified AST. The
 * other reason is that our IR design isn't very clearly
 * thought out. So we will use Document as a playground to
 * try out different IRs. Document supports each and every
 * feature that GraphQL has to offer so we keep it until IR
 * is clearly defined. Once the IR is ready we will directly
 * compile IR to Caliban's Step ADT.
