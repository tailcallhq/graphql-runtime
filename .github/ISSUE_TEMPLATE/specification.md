**Acceptance Criteria:**

To improve the likelihood of your PR being merged, ensure your proposal emphasizes:

1. **Clarity:** The design should be easy to understand and well-documented.
2. **Feasibility:** The proposed solution should be practical to implement.
3. **Maintainability:** The design should be easy to maintain and adapt in the future.
4. **Efficacy:** How effectively the proposed design addresses the problem at hand.
5. **Technical Completeness:** This should include how things should be implemented at a high-level, libraries that need to be added, and components that will need to be updated.

**IMPORTANT:** You just need to create documentation about the approach and not actually implement the approach.
