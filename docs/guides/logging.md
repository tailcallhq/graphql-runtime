title: Logging
---

Logging serves as a crucial tool for gaining insights into code execution and troubleshooting challenges in software development. The verbosity of the logs can be configured using different log levels. The log level of the application can be configured using `TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL` or `TC_LOG_LEVEL` environment variables. The available log levels are:

### error

This is the highest severity level. It indicates a critical issue that may lead to the failure of the program or a part of it.

```bash
TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL=error tailcall <COMMAND>
# or
TC_LOG_LEVEL=error tailcall <COMMAND>
```

### warn

This log level signifies potential issues or warnings that do not necessarily result in immediate failure but may require attention.

```bash
TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL=warn tailcall <COMMAND>
# or
TC_LOG_LEVEL=warn tailcall <COMMAND>
```

### info

This level offers general information about the program's execution, providing insights into its state and activities.

```bash
TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL=info tailcall <COMMAND>
# or
TC_LOG_LEVEL=info tailcall <COMMAND>
```

### debug

The `debug` log level is useful for developers during the debugging process, providing detailed information about the program's internal workings.

```bash
TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL=debug tailcall <COMMAND>
# or
TC_LOG_LEVEL=debug tailcall <COMMAND>
```

### trace

The `trace` log level is the most detailed logging level, used for fine-grained debugging. This level provides exhaustive details about the program's execution flow.

```bash
TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL=trace tailcall <COMMAND>
# or
TC_LOG_LEVEL=trace tailcall <COMMAND>
```

### off

This level serves as a special indicator for generating no logs, allowing the option to disable logging entirely.

```bash
TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL=off tailcall <COMMAND>
# or
TC_LOG_LEVEL=off tailcall <COMMAND>
```

:::info
By default, the log level is set to `info`.
:::

Log levels are hierarchical, meaning if you set the log level to a specific level, it includes all the levels above it. For example, setting the log level to `info` will include logs at the `info`, `warn`, and `error` levels, but exclude `debug` and `trace` logs.

:::info
Log levels are flexible and can be provided in either uppercase or lowercase. For instance, setting `TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` or `TAILCALL_LOG_LEVEL=debug` will yield the same result.
