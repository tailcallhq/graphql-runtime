## Installation

```bash
brew tap tailcallhq/tailcall
brew install tailcall
```

## Get Started

The below file is a standard `.graphQL` file, with a few additions such as `@server` and `@http` directives. So basically we specify the GraphQL schema and how to resolve that GraphQL schema in the same file, without having to write any code!

Now, run the following command to start the server with the full path to the jsonplaceholder.graphql file that you created above.

```bash
tc start ./jsonplaceholder.graphql
```
