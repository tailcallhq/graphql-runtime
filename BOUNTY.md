Hey there! Super pumped you’re considering joining our Bounty Program. This is where you can really show off your skills and get rewarded for it. Here’s all you need to know to jump in and make waves. 🌊

## Our Philosophy 🌟

We’re all about meritocracy here. That means the best ideas and implementations win! We love seeing your quality work and fast moves. And yes, we definitely notice when you go the extra mile. 🏆

## Quick & Quality 🏃‍♂️💨

- **Speedy Gonzalez:** We like things fast! Quick feedback, quick updates. The faster, the better!
- **A+ Quality:** But hey, don’t rush it if it means cutting corners. We want your best – make it shine! ✨

## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work 🤝

- **Join Us on Discord:** Our Discord server is THE place to collaborate, get tips, and find your next bestie. Let’s make magic together.
- **Share the Love:** Inspired by someone’s PR? Working together? Feel free to split that bounty – sharing is caring! 💖

## How to Dive In 🏊‍♀️

1. **Pick a Challenge:** Use `/attempt` in the comments to call dibs on an issue. It’s like saying “I got this!”
2. **Show Your Work:** Got an issue? Great! Now, whip up a draft PR within 24 hours to show you’re on it.
3. **Go for Gold:** Once you’re ready, switch that draft to Ready for Review. Make sure it’s polished and gleaming!
4. **Extra Mile Alert:** We’ve got bonuses for those who add that ✨special touch✨. Clean up, optimize, or fix something extra? We’re here for it!

## The Rules of the Game 📜

- **Be Quick or Be… Late:** No PR within 24 hours? Then it’s open season for that issue again.
- **There Can Only Be One:** Multiple folks can try, but only the top PR wins. If it’s a tie, the early bird gets the worm.
- **No Copycats:** Be original, be you. Don’t just copy someone else’s hard work.
- **Look Before You Leap:** If there’s already a PR in progress, maybe check out another issue instead.

## Wrapping Up 🎁

We’re stoked to have you! This program is your chance to shine and get rewarded while at it. Stick to these friendly guidelines, and let’s make something awesome together. We look forward to seeing what you bring to the table.
