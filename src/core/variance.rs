/// operations.
///
/// In type theory, an invariant type is neither covariant nor contravariant.
/// When merging two values of an invariant type, the result does not expand or
/// shrink in terms of its constraints or possibilities. Instead, merging
/// typically follows custom logic to unify the two values into one, preserving
/// their essential properties without introducing additional flexibility or
/// restrictions.
///
/// The `unify` method defines how two values of the type can be combined while
/// maintaining their invariance. This is useful in scenarios where a type must
/// strictly adhere to certain constraints, and any merging must respect those
/// constraints.

/// restrictive or specific than either of the original types.

/// The `shrink` method defines how two values of the type can be merged into a
/// new value that represents a narrower scope or more specific constraints.
/// This is useful in scenarios where combining two values should result in the
/// most restrictive interpretation.
