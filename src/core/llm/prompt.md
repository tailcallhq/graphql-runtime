Given the GraphQL type definition below, provide a response in the form of a JSONP callback. The function should be named "callback" and should return JSON suggesting at least ten suitable alternative names for the type. Each suggested name should be concise, preferably a single word, and capture the essence of the data it represents based on the roles and relationships implied by the field names.

```graphql
type T {
  name: String
  age: Int
  website: String
}
```

**Expected JSONP Format:**

```javascript
$$$JSON_START$$$
{
  "originalTypeName": "T",
  "suggestedTypeNames": ["Person", "Profile", "Member", "Individual", "Contact"],
}
$$$JSON_END$$$
```
